Debug builds aren't supported. Suppress debug build defines, include Mso headers, and then restore the defines.\n\n=== Versioning\n* Fix beachball integration by making the repo public.\n* Change publish command to go through the motions without the final step of pushing to the NPM registry.\n\n=== Manifest Library: ABI\n* Split each class into a reference-counted public interface and an internal implementation.\n* Use only primitive types and interfaces.\n* Replace Error objects with error codes.\n* Separate publicly headers for inclusion in NuGet package\n* Export public library functions.",
